        AnnotationPress is designed to provide a user friendly tool that helps scientists annotate scientific claims, data, and evidence in HTML and PDF documents. The current version is configured to annotated drug-drug interactions in both full text journal articles and structured product labeling. This is a particularly challenging domain that required the development of several annotation workflows which we think will be useful for for other scientific domains. A key aspect of AnnotationPress is its use of annotation plug-ins which make the tool is easily adaptable to other annotation use cases. Another distinctive feature is that AnnotationPress implements the <a href='https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2041-1480-5-28'>Micropublication</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/">Open Annotation data</a> standards. These standards specify how to relate annotations in target documents about data, methods, and materials to scientific claims.
