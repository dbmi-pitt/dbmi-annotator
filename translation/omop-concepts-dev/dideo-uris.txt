1. interact_with

Evidence base:
used for the predicate in any scientific claim that relates one drug to another using "interacts with"

DIDEO:
URI: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DIDEO_00000015
Term: metabolic potential drug-drug interaction
Definition: A potential drug drug interaction that is about a drug metabolism.

2. drug product and active ingredient

Evidence base:
used for any drug product that is used in scientific claims that
relate a drug to another drug or enzyme. We tend to think of these as
"active ingredients" but in DIDEO, "active ingredient" is a role not a
material entity.

DIDEO:
URI: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DRON_00000005
Term: drug product
Definition: a material entity (1) containing at least one scattered molecular aggregate as part (the active ingredient) and (2) that is the bearer of a clinical drug role

3. enzyme:

Evidence base:
This would used to specify a specific enzyme when annotating evidence
for or against various claims where an enzyme is a part of the claim.

DIDEO:
URI: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000427
Term: enzyme
Definition: (protein or rna) or has_part (protein or rna) and has_function some GO:0003824 (catalytic activity)

4. precipitant and object 

Evidence base:
drug role as precipitant or object that involved in a potential drug drug interaction. 
The role precipitant and object is exclusive relation.

precipitant
URI: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DIDEO_00000013
Term: precipitant drug role
Definition: The role that inheres in a drug product or drug ingredient that is realized by affecting another drug pharmacokinetically or pharmacodynamically in a drug drug interaction.

object
URI: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DIDEO_00000012
Term: object drug role
Definition: The role that inheres in a drug product or drug ingredient and that is realized by being affected by another drug pharmacokinetically or pharmacodynamically in a drug drug interaction.

5. auc, cmax, clearance, halflife ratio

Evidence base: auc, cmax, clearance, halflife ratio data captured in article

auc: 
URI: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DIDEO_00000093 
Term: area under the curve ratio
Definition: 
Alternative Term: AUC ratio

cmax: 
URI: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DIDEO_00000099
Term: drug maximum concentration ratio
Definition: A pharmacokinetic parameter ratio that describes the relation between the drug maximum concentration measurements for a given active ingredient or metabolite in an organism with and without the inhibiting drug present in the organism.
Alternative Term: Cmax ratio

clearance
URI: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DIDEO_00000101
Term: hepatic clearance ratio
Definition: A pharmacokinetic parameter ratio that describes the relation between the measurement of the volume of blood, serum, or plasma from which an active ingredient or a metabolite is completely removed by the liver in a given amount of time in an organism with and without the inhibiting drug present in the organism.
Alternative Term: CL_H ratio

halflife
URI: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DIDEO_00000100 
Term: half-life ratio
Definition: A pharmacokinetic parameter ratio that describes the relation between the time it takes for half of a given active ingredient or metabolite to be removed from the system of an organism with and without the inhibiting drug present in the organism.
Alternative Term: t1/2 ratio

6. phenotype and genotype

Evidence base: For scientific claim with evidence type as phenotype clinical trial, the

phenotype
URI: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DIDEO_00000103
Term: evidence information from phenotyped pharmacokinetic trial
Definition: An evidence information content entity that is about a clinical drug trial that focusses on pharmacokinetics and that has organisms as participants that participated in phenotyping.
Alternative Term: EV_CT_PK_Phenotype

genotype
URI: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DIDEO_00000076
Term: evidence information from genotyped pharmacokinetic trial
Definition: An evidence information content entity that is about a clinical drug trial that focusses on pharmacokinetics and that has organisms as participants that participated in genotyping.
Alternative Term: EV_CT_PK_Genotype
