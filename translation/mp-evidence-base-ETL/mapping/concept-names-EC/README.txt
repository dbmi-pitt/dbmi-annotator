PROCEDURE:
1. Opened drug-list-mapped.csv in LibreOffice Calc or equivalent program.
2. Used Filters on the "RxNorm" column to find all rows that had an RxNorm mapping.
3. Sorted these rows ascending.
4. Copy and paste these 265 rows into text editor to generate INSERT statements for a temporary table of these RxNorm mappings.
5. Temporary table generated in the following .sql file:
	concept-names-EC/RxNorm-to-FDA-Preferred.sql 
6. This .sql file then queries an output of the FDA preferred terms that can then be easily ported back to the drug-list-mapped.csv file that was previously already opened and sorted in a spreadsheet program.
	output file:
	concept-names-EC/rxnorm-output.csv
