The mappings of qualifier name and OMOP concept code are used for standardize drug names in evidence base

(1) Qualifier concept code mapping

drug-list-mapped.csv is the mapping file for qualifier identifier
columns: name (qualifier name), concept name, RxNorm, MESH, PRO (Protein Ontology), NDFRT, conceptId (omop concept id), comment

The script tool.py parse drug-list-mapped csv and return dictionary of drug URI mapping. It's called when translating annotation from elasticsearch JSON  document to PostgreSQL DB, filling the concept code for drug terms in annotation.

function getDrugMappingDict(inputfile, PostgreSQL connection)

Besides, run the script standalone will print term with URI when mappings either RxNorm or MeSH available. (Only RxNorm and MeSH currenly in OMOP vocabulary among listed sources)

$ python tool.py
