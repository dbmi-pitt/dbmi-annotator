At screening, the volunteers were judged to be in good health on the basis of medical history, physical examination, and routine laboratory measurement results. Volunteers had ended any short-duration courses of prescription medications, herbal medications, or dietary supplements (e.g., St. John's wort, ginkgo biloba, garlic supplements), vitamins, Seville oranges, grapefruit, or grapefruit juice at least 14 days before the administration of the first dose of the study drug. Prescription medications were not administered during the study. Volunteers had stopped over-the-counter medications no less than 2 days before the first administration of the study drug. Occasional use of acetaminophen or ibuprofen was allowed during the study for the treatment of pain. Volunteers could not consume alcohol from 72 h before the first dose of the study drug through the follow-up visit and were nonsmokers (subjects who stopped smoking at least 6 months before screening were considered nonsmokers)."
