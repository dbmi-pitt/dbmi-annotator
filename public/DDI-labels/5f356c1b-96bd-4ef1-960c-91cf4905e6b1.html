Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. </p>    <p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24&nbsp;short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400&nbsp;patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug&nbsp;versus&nbsp;placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in <a href="#t2">Table 2</a>. </p>    <a name="t2"></a>    <div class="scrollingtable">    <table width="100%">      <caption>       <span>Table 2: Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated </span>      </caption>      <colgroup>      <col align="left" width="48.600%" />       <col align="left" width="51.400%" />      </colgroup>     <tbody class="Headless">       <tr class="First">        <td class="Botrule Lrule Rrule Toprule" align="center" valign="top"><span class="Bold">Age Range</span></td>       <td class="Botrule Rrule Toprule" align="center" valign="top"><span class="Bold">Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated</span></td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td class="Botrule Lrule Rrule" align="center" valign="top"></td>       <td class="Botrule Rrule" align="center" valign="top">Increases Compared to Placebo </td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td class="Botrule Lrule Rrule" align="center" valign="top">&lt;18 </td>       <td class="Botrule Rrule" align="center" valign="top">14 additional cases </td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td class="Botrule Lrule Rrule" align="center" valign="top">18–24 </td>       <td class="Botrule Rrule" align="center" valign="top">5 additional cases </td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td class="Botrule Lrule Rrule" align="center" valign="top"></td>       <td class="Botrule Rrule" align="center" valign="top">Decreases Compared to Placebo </td>       </tr>       <tr>        <td class="Botrule Lrule Rrule" align="center" valign="top">25–64 </td>       <td class="Botrule Rrule" align="center" valign="top">1 fewer case </td>       </tr>       <tr class="Last">        <td class="Botrule Lrule Rrule" align="center" valign="top">≥65 </td>       <td class="Botrule Rrule" align="center" valign="top">6 fewer cases </td>       </tr>      </tbody>     </table>   </div>    <p> No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials.

Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported and appeared to be reversible when PROZAC was discontinued.

While these reactions are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with PROZAC. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.

In particular, some evidence suggests that SSRIs can cause such untoward sexual experiences. Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance, cited in product labeling, are likely to underestimate their actual incidence. In patients enrolled in US&nbsp;Major Depressive Disorder, OCD, and bulimia placebo-controlled clinical trials, decreased libido was the only sexual side effect reported by at least 2% of patients taking fluoxetine (4%&nbsp;fluoxetine, &lt;1%&nbsp;placebo).

As in adults, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine accumulated extensively following multiple oral dosing; steady-state concentrations were achieved within 3&nbsp;to&nbsp;4&nbsp;weeks of daily dosing. </p>    </div>   </div>   <span class="close-toggle show-js"><a href="#">Close</a></span> </div></li><li><a href="#">13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</a> <div class="Section toggle-content closed" data-sectioncode="43680-8">   <a name="s123"></a>  <a name="section-13"></a>   <p></p>    <div class="Section" data-sectioncode="34083-6">    <a name="s124"></a>   <a name="section-13.1"></a>    <p></p>    <h2>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility </h2>    <div class="Section" data-sectioncode="42229-5">     <a name="s125"></a>    <a name="section-13.1.1"></a>     <p></p>     <p class="First"> <span class="Italics">Carcinogenicity</span> — The dietary administration of fluoxetine to rats and mice for 2&nbsp;years at doses of up to 10&nbsp;and 12&nbsp;mg/kg/day, respectively [approximately 1.2&nbsp;and 0.7&nbsp;times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose&nbsp;(MRHD) of 80&nbsp;mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis], produced no evidence of carcinogenicity. </p>    </div>    <div class="Section" data-sectioncode="42229-5">     <a name="s126"></a>    <a name="section-13.1.2"></a>     <p></p>     <p class="First"> <span class="Italics">Mutagenicity</span> — Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine have been shown to have no genotoxic effects based on the following assays:&nbsp;bacterial mutation assay, DNA repair assay in cultured rat hepatocytes, mouse lymphoma assay, and in&nbsp;vivo sister chromatid exchange assay in Chinese hamster bone marrow cells. </p>    </div>    <div class="Section" data-sectioncode="42229-5">     <a name="s127"></a>    <a name="section-13.1.3"></a>     <p></p>     <p class="First"> <span class="Italics">Impairment of Fertility</span> — Two&nbsp;fertility studies conducted in adult rats at doses of up to 7.5&nbsp;and 12.5&nbsp;mg/kg/day (approximately 0.9&nbsp;and 1.5&nbsp;times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) indicated that fluoxetine had no adverse effects on fertility.

Patients in the 8-week studies received either 20&nbsp;or 60&nbsp;mg/day of PROZAC or placebo in the morning. Patients in the 16-week study received a fixed PROZAC dose of 60&nbsp;mg/day (once a day) or placebo. Patients in these 3&nbsp;studies had moderate to severe bulimia with median binge-eating and vomiting frequencies ranging from 7&nbsp;to 10&nbsp;per week and 5&nbsp;to 9&nbsp;per week, respectively. In these 3&nbsp;studies, PROZAC 60&nbsp;mg, but not 20&nbsp;mg, was statistically significantly superior to placebo in reducing the number of binge-eating and vomiting episodes per week. The statistically significantly superior effect of 60&nbsp;mg versus placebo was present as early as Week&nbsp;1 and persisted throughout each study. The PROZAC-related reduction in bulimic episodes appeared to be independent of baseline depression as assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. In each of these 3&nbsp;studies, the treatment effect, as measured by differences between PROZAC 60&nbsp;mg and placebo on median reduction from baseline in frequency of bulimic behaviors at endpoint, ranged from 1&nbsp;to 2&nbsp;episodes per week for binge-eating and 2&nbsp;to 4&nbsp;episodes per week for vomiting. The size of the effect was related to baseline frequency, with greater reductions seen in patients with higher baseline frequencies. Although some patients achieved freedom from binge-eating and purging as a result of treatment, for the majority, the benefit was a partial reduction in the frequency of binge-eating and purging. </p>    <p>In a longer-term trial, 150&nbsp;patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for Bulimia Nervosa, purging subtype, who had responded during a single-blind, 8-week acute treatment phase with PROZAC&nbsp;60&nbsp;mg/day, were randomized to continuation of PROZAC 60&nbsp;mg/day or placebo, for up to 52&nbsp;weeks of observation for relapse.
